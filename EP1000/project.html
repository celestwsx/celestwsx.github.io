                  <h2>Project Plan: The Grooveshroom</h2>
                  <p>Originally, I was planning on creating a music reactive lamp. When music is played or when someone is singing, the light in the mushroom will either dim or brighten depending on the volume of the sound.</p> 
                  <p>However, the microphone that was provided could not read the differences in volume, so I have changed the input device to be a simple button.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I want a mushroom lamp is because mushrooms are adorable and mushroom shaped things are gaining popularity.</p>

                  <h3>3D Model</h3>
                  <iframe src="https://hotmail187155.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcf86561e6379239054?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
                  <h3>Materials Needed</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Button (1x)</li>
                    <li>NeoPixel LEDs strip (1-3x)</li>
                    <li>Wires (as many as you need)</li>
                    <li>Arduino Board (1x)</li>
                    <li>Breadboard (1x)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
                  <p>The base where we will store the Arduino boards and circuits will be laser cut. It is around 140mm wide. I originally wanted to do a hexagonal log but I found it too difficult to create the 3D model for, so I ended up doing a fingerjoint box.</p>
                  <img src="grooveshroom/base.jpg" style="float:inline-end;height:40%;">
                  <h3>3D Printing</h3>
                  <p>The Mushroom cap and stalk will be 3D printed. The infills will be at 5% because it is just a proof of concept and not an actual product for people to use. I made the walls 1mm thick because I want to print it as fast as possible without losing the structural integrity.</p>
                  <p>If it was possible, the 3D printed mushroom would be translucent instead so we can see the light shining through the cap. In this case, we put it beneath the cap so it shines downwards.</p>

                  <h3>Mistakes & Tips</h3>
                  <p>While I was laser cutting, I accidentally created windows that were not attached to the walls. This resulted in a large hole instead of a patterned window as seen in the 3D model above. I managed to fix it by redoing the windows in Adobe Illustrator to be the ones you see in the final laser cut box.</p>
                  <img src="grooveshroom/window.jpg" style="float:inline-end;height:40%;">
                  <p>Another thing that could have went wrong but thankfully did not is the engravings on the top of the box. You have to make the lines into different colours so that you can give different settings to the laser while cutting.</p>
